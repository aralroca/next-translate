# Complex example

Similar than the basic example but with some extras:

- TypeScript
- Webpack 5 
- MDX
- With _app.js on top
- Custom interpolation with ${thisFormat} instead of the {{defaultFormat}}
- pages located on src/pages folder
- Loading locales from src/translations with a different structure
